## Position thy self
Used the `/challenge/run` command, which helped in telling where the flag is by telling me the path to the flag. Used  `cd /usr/share/doc/fontconfig` to change my directory and run the `/challenge/run` command to obtain the flag.

## Position elsewhere
This challenge was very similar to the previous one.
Used the `/challenge/run` command, which helped in telling where the flag is by telling me the path to the flag. Used  `cd /sys` to change my directory and run the `/challenge/run` command to obtain the flag.
